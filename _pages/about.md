I am a faculty member in the Statistics department at Colorado State, where a I split my time between teaching, research and consulting work for the [Graybill Statistics and Data Science Laboratory] (https://statlab.colostate.edu/).
I graduated with a B.A. in mathematics from St. Olaf College, and did my Ph.D. work in Statistics at Cornell University with Carlos Bustamante and Jim Booth.
