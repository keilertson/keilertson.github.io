I am a faculty member in the Statistics department at Colorado State, where a I split my time between teaching, research and consulting work for the [Graybill Statistics and Data Science Laboratory](https://statlab.colostate.edu/).

I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from St. Olaf College, and did my Ph.D. work in Statistics at Cornell University with Carlos Bustamante and Jim Booth.  In graduate school my work focused on estimation and inference for mixed models and latent variable models with applications in population genetics and functional genomics. 

I worked as a Biostatistician at [The Gladstone Institutes](https://gladstone.org/) from 2011-2013, collaborating with researchers in the areas of Neuroscience, Immunology and Virology, and Cardiology.  

From 2014-2019 I was faculty in the Statistics department at Penn State University.  Here much of my energy focused on collaborative work in the area of infectious disease dynamics, and consulting as a biostatistician in the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) core.  Additionally, I helped manage the statistical consulting center, and I taught the practicum and capstone courses for the statistics graduate and undergraduate students. 

In 2019, I joined the faculty at Colorado State University in the Statistics department and the Graybill Statistics and Data Science Laboratory.  I also have an appointment in the Colorado School of Public Health.
