As an applied statistician I have worked with scientists in a variety of fields from behavioral neuroscience, biomechanics, functional genomics, and most recently quantitative epidemiology. My research is driven by application specific challenges in statistical modeling.
I am a member of the [Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/).   My work has contributed to the development of a novel state-space model for estimating measles disease burden at the country level. The primary aim of this work is to improve our understanding of the impact of public health measures.
